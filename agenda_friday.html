                                  <p class="card-text">When we first hear something is changing in our lives, whether it’s a relationship, news we found out at the doctor, or a change in our role at work, feelings of stress and anxiety immediately come up. We start thinking: <em>“How is this going to affect me?” “Can I do this?” “What if I can’t?”</em>  We’ve all had these moments of fear and doubt when we are approached with change. But what really is the root of those thoughts? Why do we go into panic mode just because there is a change versus embracing it with hope and positivity? Let’s get to the root of these feelings and learn how to overcome these feelings; embrace change and thrive!</p>

The College has engaged business partners, federal agencies and academia in defining the role of the technical workforce. Members of this network represent manufacturers, integrators, healthcare environments, home automation and smart city applications. This session will share new research data used to define common work roles, student competencies and program outcomes that can be used in developing degreed programs, majors, certificates and courses to teach applications of IoT technologies. The session will also share new course content used to enable business applications of this emerging technology. The team has also developed multidisciplinary content that is available through the network.</p>

What happens if we mesh these two topics together? That gives us "cybersecurity analytics," which has become a key element in the cybersecurity world today. Organizations are using data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) to not only proactively respond to attacks but also to predict attacks before they occur. And new industry certifications on cybersecurity analytics are now available. What exactly is cybersecurity analytics? How is it being used? What cybersecurity analytics certifications are available? And how can someone who is interested in this key area learn more about it as a career path? This session will look at cybersecurity analytics.</p>

More than half of jobs in the world today use a computer. In addition to computers, most working adults are, at least somewhat, fluent in the use of smartphones, smart TVs, tablets, home assistants, and more.  As the benefits from the number and types of devices have grown exponentially, so has the potential for their misuse. Digital forensics is a branch of the forensic sciences involving identifying, preserving, analyzing, and documenting digital evidence.  Join us in this session to learn what is digital evidence, where to find it, digital forensics principles and processes, and how the use of digital forensics has impacted criminal investigations over the past decade.</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the emphasis on population health, therefore potentially amplifying demand for healthcare workforce professionals in this area. There is an urgent need to explore and define the roles of health information management (HIM) professionals in the population health workforce. This study sought to identify the skill sets and qualifications needed, and HIM education alignment with skills necessary for HIM professionals entering the population health workforce. An intentionally broad internet search of job postings was conducted to determine skills in population health. Population health-related job descriptions and qualification requirements were abstracted and analyzed using ATLAS.ti. Three common job categories were identified: management, analytics, and coding. Skill set requirements included soft skills, problem solving, project management, research, and data analysis. The study results identified HIM educational alignment and found that HIM professionals are generally a good fit to meet the increased need in the population health workforce.</p>

                                            <p>Many changes have occurred in the workforce since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The most important overarching topic has undoubtedly been the Work from Home (WFH) movement.  As the pandemic accelerated, workers were unexpectedly sent home to continue working.  The result was a change in the attitudes that both employees and employers felt about having employees work from home.  It is anticipated that more people will permanently work from home after the pandemic ends.</p> 
                                            <p>While the urgency of the pandemic created this significant shift, it did so without regard for how people would be impacted from the perspective of ethics and technology.  This is because the shift occurred without the proper support systems and necessary processes in place to ensure people could smoothly transition.</p>
                                            <p>There are resulting ethical and technical implications that must be considered as the shift to working from home becomes more permanent for some.  As an example, some employees may benefit from permanently working from home.  Companies may have to reconsider working spaces.  There are implications to women in the workforce, such as balancing work with supervising children attending school from home.</p>
                                            <p>In terms of technology, high speed internet will still be problematic for those living in rural areas.  Those with suitable broadband access will have to juggle multiple users.  And those that cannot afford a computer at home will likely be issued less effective equipment, as has happened in education.</p> 
                                            <p>In this session we will explore the implications impacting the growing Work from Home movement.  </p>

                                        <p class="card-text collapsible-content">In January 2019, the Brookings Institution released report on automation and A.I. which found that 28% of Louisville’s jobs were at high risk for automation, and nearly 26% of neighboring Lexington’s jobs were identified as high risk. As a result, Mayor Greg Fischer tasked Louisville Metro Government to develop a solution that would add new tech jobs to Louisville and strengthen its workforce so its prepared for the next tech revolution. In July 2019, LouTechWorks, Louisville’s comprehensive tech talent pipeline development program was unveiled. This first-of-its-kind initiative to include K-12, community colleges, public and private four-year universities, and nonprofit entities has seen great success since its inception. The same week LouTechWorks was launched, Microsoft was in town to announce the first-ever Future of Work Initiative (FWI), a public-private partnership between Microsoft and the city of Louisville.  This initiative was designed to kickstart a data ecosystem in Louisville based around innovative technologies such as AI and IoT.  FWI has specifically focused on increasing equity, partnering with education, industry, and community to diversify the data science industry and spark interest in these pathways.  Ultimately, our goal is to provide a framework for Louisville to become a regional hub for AI in social innovation.  Now entering their third year, both LouTechWorks and Louisville Future of Work continue to work in partnership to broaden the tech talent pipeline in Louisville in meaningful ways.</p>
