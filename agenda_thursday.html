                                            Our commitment to the communities we serve goes beyond improving the health of our patients. As a not-for-profit institution, the monetary benefits we generate far outweigh the taxes we would pay if we were in business to make money. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Med Center Health also maintains public-private partnerships with the area’s finest academic institutions, such as Western Kentucky University and the University of Kentucky. And we are the only provider in the region that partners with UK HealthCare. This unique relationship increases opportunities for research and technology while gaining access to the latest in evidence-based medicine.
                                        </p>

                                            In addition, the University of Kentucky College of Medicine – Bowling Green Campus, the first 4-year regional medical school in Kentucky, is located on the campus of The Medical Center at Bowling Green. As a teaching hospital, The Medical Center is committed to constantly raising the bar to provide better healthcare for residents of Southcentral Kentucky.
