                                            <p class="blocky-text">While I received my formal education at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Advertising and minor in Marketing, education has always been my passion.  I’m the wife of a school principal and the daughter of a retired educator.  What can I say – it’s in my DNA.  I was fortunate to work in the local and private school systems for a couple of years, and for the last decade leading up to 2020, I served at the Education Director at the Southern Kentucky Performing Arts Center.  Through that role, I developed an extensive skill set which included building and fostering relationships in local/regional schools with educators and administrators. The value of cultivating positive and vital relationships are keys to organizational success. During my time as Director, I developed, organized and executed multiple education-centered events and marketing collateral at the arts center - involving a handful of students to welcoming thousands in the facility.  My strengths include thinking through the tiniest of details while also keeping my arms around the big picture.  This has served me well in my new role at Southcentral Kentucky Community and Technical College as an Administrative Assistant in the Business and Information Technologies Division.  The COVID pandemic allowed me to pivot in my career and continue to focus on what I am passionate about - education. Student success is my number one priority in this role, and I work hard every day to provide that level of excellence to all our student population as well as our faculty and staff.  Most recently, I was awarded the prestigious Skyctc Support Staff Award of Excellence for going above and beyond in my job.  I take great pride in what I do for the college and enjoy helping others succeed.  </p>

I have 26 years of experience in association management and higher education. Most recently, I worked at WKU for 17 years and have 12 years of management experience.

I have 21 year-old twins, Kristin and Ryan, who are seniors at Murray State University. Since Kristin runs cross country and track for MSU and Ryan runs cross country, I am also a Murray State fan!
